# Cursor Information Retriever 
A simple program to give the position and the color at the position of the cursor.

This program can be easily accessed through the command prompt and passed an integer value to set the delay time before running. If not passed a value then it is set to wait 3 seconds before getting cursor position and color.

The main use of this program is to assist the creation of the Crypto Data Collection program to help find positions for the computer to click and to find colors to tell the program what is happening on screen.
